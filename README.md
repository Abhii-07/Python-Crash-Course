# Python-Crash-Course

### Lesson 1: Introduction to Python
- Explanation: Learn about Python, its history, and why it's a popular language.
- Exercise: Write a simple "Hello, World!" program in Python.

### Lesson 2: Variables and Data Types
- Explanation: Understand how to declare variables and the different data types in Python.
- Exercise: Create variables for storing various types of data (strings, integers, floats) and perform basic operations with them.

### Lesson 3: Control Flow
- Explanation: Learn about conditional statements (if-else) and loops (for, while) in Python.
- Exercise: Write a program to determine if a given number is even or odd using if-else statements. Then, create a program using a loop to print the first 10 multiples of a number entered by the user.

### Lesson 4: Functions
- Explanation: Understand how to define and use functions in Python.
- Exercise: Write a function to calculate the factorial of a given number.

### Lesson 5: Lists and List Comprehensions
- Explanation: Learn about lists and how to use list comprehensions in Python.
- Exercise: Create a list of numbers and use list comprehension to filter out the even numbers from the list.

### Lesson 6: Dictionaries and Sets
- Explanation: Understand dictionaries and sets in Python.
- Exercise: Create a dictionary of words and their meanings. Then, write a program to check if a word exists in the dictionary and get its meaning.

### Lesson 7: File Handling
- Explanation: Learn how to read from and write to files in Python.
- Exercise: Write a program to read a text file, count the occurrences of each word, and write the word frequencies to another file.

### Lesson 8: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Explanation: Introduce the concepts of classes, objects, and inheritance in Python.
- Exercise: Create a class to represent a car, and then create subclasses for specific car types with different attributes and methods.

### Lesson 9: Modules and Packages
- Explanation: Understand how to use modules and packages to organize Python code.
- Exercise: Create a package with multiple modules, each containing functions to perform specific tasks.

### Lesson 10: Python Libraries
- Explanation: Introduce some popular Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
- Exercise: Use NumPy to perform mathematical operations on arrays and Pandas to manipulate data in a DataFrame.
